    "description": "Money maniac Fernan Pellenberg is the young heir of House Pellenberg, one of the Empire’s most prestigious houses, and a top student at the Imperial Academy. However, he’s infamous for something else: his obsession with money. As a ruthless money-hound, he only acknowledges those who bring him profit and views everything in the world through the lens of monetary value. People avoid him, finding his greed repulsive.But was divine punishment finally upon him?One day, out of nowhere, disaster strikes Fernan like a bolt from the blue. As his consciousness begins to fade, something attempts to invade and take over his mind, but Fernan forcefully expels it instead.From that moment on, he begins to see something strange: a prophetic book that reveals the future. And not just any future, but a prophecy of the end of the world.",

Save this world.\"The next thing Gray knew, he woke up in his hometown, which should long have been destroyed. It was the place he started his life of a loser—and was now the stage for his second chance.\"This time, I will survive!\"With the power to transcend time and his memories of the future, Gray sets out to become a warrior even stronger than the heroes.",

In the world of \"Dungeon and Stone\", only one city remained standing after the destruction of the world. A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a 'lower-class citizen'. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life. With the skills he has accumulated over nine years of gameplay and a stupidly strong barbarian physique, he strives to survive in this game...",

    "description": "Money maniac Fernan Pellenberg is the young heir of House Pellenberg, one of the Empire’s most prestigious houses, and a top student at the Imperial Academy. However, he’s infamous for something else: his obsession with money. As a ruthless money-hound, he only acknowledges those who bring him profit and views everything in the world through the lens of monetary value. People avoid him, finding his greed repulsive.But was divine punishment finally upon him?One day, out of nowhere, disaster strikes Fernan like a bolt from the blue. As his consciousness begins to fade, something attempts to invade and take over his mind, but Fernan forcefully expels it instead.From that moment on, he begins to see something strange: a prophetic book that reveals the future. And not just any future, but a prophecy of the end of the world.",

In the world of \"Dungeon and Stone\", only one city remained standing after the destruction of the world. A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a 'lower-class citizen'. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life. With the skills he has accumulated over nine years of gameplay and a stupidly strong barbarian physique, he strives to survive in this game...",

I don’t even know why my name is Chundong. This world is a novel I wrote.However, I ended up as a character I'd never even written about. Other than getting accepted into the Agent Military Academy, this character isn't particularly extraordinary, has no interactions with anyone in the novel, and isn’t even mentioned at all. Therefore, I became an extra in the novel....No. I became dust on the novel.",

In the world of \"Dungeon and Stone\", only one city remained standing after the destruction of the world. A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a 'lower-class citizen'. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life.

However, just as he entered the boss room, he saw a notification alerting him that he had cleared the tutorial and that he had possessed the body of the barbarian, Bjorn Jandel, who was a playable character in the game. In the world of \"Dungeon and Stone\", only one city remained standing after the destruction of the world. A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a 'lower-class citizen'. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life. With the skills he has accumulated over nine years of gameplay and a stupidly strong barbarian physique, he strives to survive in this game...",

It was the place he started his life of a loser—and was now the stage for his second chance.\"This time, I will survive!\"With the power to transcend time and his memories of the future, Gray sets out to become a warrior even stronger than the heroes.",

In the world of \"Dungeon and Stone\", only one city remained standing after the destruction of the world. A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a 'lower-class citizen'. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life.

Instead, he was guided by Chronos, the Master of Time. He was bestowed an unknown power, and with it he delivered a powerful blow to the Liquidator, shaking the threads of fate itself.But just as a chance of victory appeared, another beam of light struck, Gray's body reducing to nothing......and Chronos's voice thundered, \"I shall send you to the past. Save this world.\"The next thing Gray knew, he woke up in his hometown, which should long have been destroyed. It was the place he started his life of a loser—and was now the stage for his second chance.\"This time, I will survive!\"With the power to transcend time and his memories of the future, Gray sets out to become a warrior even stronger than the heroes.",

However, just as he entered the boss room, he saw a notification alerting him that he had cleared the tutorial and that he had possessed the body of the barbarian, Bjorn Jandel, who was a playable character in the game. In the world of \"Dungeon and Stone\", only one city remained standing after the destruction of the world. A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a 'lower-class citizen'. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life. With the skills he has accumulated over nine years of gameplay and a stupidly strong barbarian physique, he strives to survive in this game...",

In the world of \"Dungeon and Stone\", only one city remained standing after the destruction of the world. A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a 'lower-class citizen'. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life. With the skills he has accumulated over nine years of gameplay and a stupidly strong barbarian physique, he strives to survive in this game...",

    "description": "Seventeen years ago, the world was saved from destruction by the Seven Heroes. But it came with the sacrifice of the strongest one among them, Seomun Yeop. Now that there is peace, beings like the Seven Heroes known as “espers” no longer have use for their supernatural powers. That’s where Battle Field comes in, an action VR game specifically created to allow espers to showcase their skills. Unfortunately, Korea hasn’t been doing so well in the recent tournaments, making it hard to believe that it was once home to the greatest esper in history. But just when all hope seems lost, Seomun Yeop miraculously returns! Will the legendary hero be able to save his people yet again?",

In the world of \"Dungeon and Stone\", only one city remained standing after the destruction of the world. A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a 'lower-class citizen'. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life.

[Chronicles of the Martial God's Return] The Ultimate Martial Divine Demon, Dan Woohyun, was sealed up because he was too strong for the world to handle. After a millennium passed by, he was released from his seal and felt like everything was meaningless as he wandered the back alleys... Just as he fell down because he was sick of the world, a small hand appeared in front of him. \"What's this?\" asked Dan Woohyun. \"A dumpling!\" came a reply. This was the first time in his life that someone had been nice to him without any impure intentions, and that changed his fate.
